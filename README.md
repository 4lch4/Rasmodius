# Rasmodius (WIP)

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Alcha/Rasmodius.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Rasmodius, otherwise known as **[M. Rasmodius](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Wizard)**, is a Discord
bot for interacting with the [Stardew Valley Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/). All of the data
that is made available by this bot is from the previously mentioned wiki.

## Current State of Affairs

Currently, the bot does absolutely nothing. This is just a skeleton of a project on Github. The next
steps involve building the actual bot and setting up a way to access the wiki without angering those
who run the wiki. The bot itself will be using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) and everything
will be licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0][license]
license.
